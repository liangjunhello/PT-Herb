Let me know the absolute path to a codebase you'd like me to explore?\n\nAlternatively, if you have specific files or directories you'd like me to search for, please provide those paths, and I can demonstrate the search capabilities."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":166,"output_tokens":571,"cache_read_input_tokens":653}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"f8f58313-1c30-48f4-8c23-f7e207d1aa25","timestamp":"2025-11-16T14:38:04.633Z"}
